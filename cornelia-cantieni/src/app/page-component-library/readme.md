# page-component-library

The page and component library displays all views of the components and all pages for the website. It's a reference of how the components are builded and how to reuse it.

### Usage
* Generate a [new component](../../docs/code-scaffolding.md) for the library
* Generate a new component in the views and add it in the [app-routing.module.ts](../app-routing.module.ts)
* Add a new route for the generated view in the [page-component-library.component.ts](./page-component-library.component.ts)
