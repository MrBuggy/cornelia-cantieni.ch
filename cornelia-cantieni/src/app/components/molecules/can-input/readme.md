# can-input

Form element input with different states. No outline for this element, because the lighting cursor, the floating label and the marked value on focus are clear enough.

### States
* `state-can-input--active` styling for active input
* `state-can-input--disabled` styling for disabled input
* `state-can-input--error` styling for error input with hint
* `state-can-input--warning` styling for warning input with hint
